In this practice, I used Google Cloud Platform services, where I created a cluster on which I installed and configured Hadoop. After that, I created a virtual machine that I set up for using ElasticSearch. Then, I connected the cluster to the virtual machine, which allowed me to work with the data that I had already preloaded into the cluster. Finally, thanks to the use of Kibana, I was able to create a graphical representation of the data.
